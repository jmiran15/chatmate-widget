You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage

- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX.

UI and Styling

- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
